<h2 class="Title2"> Type of Government  </h2>

    <p class="info2"> Saffrons Government is set up as a strong mayor plan. </p>
    <p class="info2"> This means our council has power but our mayor has the power to veto what ever they feel they must. </p>
    <p class="info2"> This is most closely related to the president and congress. </p>
  <p class="info2"> The council picked this because the council wants to run by them selves but,  </p>
    <p class="info2"> also want some one to over see them and step in if they feel they are doing something wrong. </p>
  
  
    <p class="info2"> Our city council will have 7 members! </p>
